This project builds a multivariable linear regression model to predict housing prices using the Boston Housing Dataset.
The goal is to explore relationships between housing features and prices and use the model to estimate the value of a specific property.
The dataset includes various attributes of Boston neighborhoods, such as:
CRIM: Crime rate per capita
RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (pollution)
DIS: Distance to employment centers
LSTAT: % of lower-status population
PTRATIO: Student-teacher ratio
... and several others.
It comes from the sklearn.datasets.load_boston().
